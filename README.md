# Student-Manage-System
java project
Utilized Java to code every function and method to implement ‘add student’, ‘modify student info’, and ‘inquire student’ methods to make the program more complete and save more time for users to operate this program; added anadministrator mode function to let the administrator manage all student information; added parent mode to help parents inquire about students’ information without permission to adjust students. These modes lead this program to be more reliable and more practical.
Analyzed and solved problems in different sub-fields such as improving some methods to be more universal and more effective. Kept abreast of the latest development of Java programming and got in touch with the latest JDK 17 new features.
